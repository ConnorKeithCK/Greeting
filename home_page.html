        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Connor Keith and I am a third-year IT student on the software development track. I grew up in Amelia, OH and have a twin sister (who also goes to UC) and 
            I have 2 dog and 2 cats. I started programming in middle school when I taught myself Java, Python, and Lua. I have also dabbled in C# however have primarly focused
            on Java. I also used BASIC in high school for a robotics class.
            I'm excited to learn more about front-end web development using JavaScript and Node.JS, as well as how to incorporate version control with Git in my projects. 
            My favorite games to play currently are Rainbow Six Siege, Battlefield, and Batallion 1944.
